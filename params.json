Create your blog folder structure\r\n\r\n  **NOTE**: one can use the _**src/main/test/scala/scalatictest**_ folder\r\n  as a starting point.\r\n\r\n  The blog folder structure can reside anywhere on your machine\r\n  and needs to look like this:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  blog            -> root folder of your blog; can have any name you want\r\n    |_ new        -> any markdown source files that should be (re)rendered to HTML\r\n    |_ source     -> contains any files that are not blog posts (e.g. html, css, js)\r\n      |_ posts    -> all markdown source files that have already been rendered to HTML\r\n    |_ target     -> this is where your generated blog will be saved\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Only the _**new**_ and _**source**_ folders need to be manually created -\r\n  the _source/posts_ and _target_ folders are created automatically if they\r\n  don't exist.\r\n\r\n  Also, it is required that _**header.html**_ and _**footer.html**_ files exist\r\n  in the _source_ folder.\r\n\r\n  Any other file (except directories) present in the _source_ folder are\r\n  considered \"static\" files and will be copied without any transformation to\r\n  the _target_ folder.\r\n\r\n2. Clone the [Scalatic](https://github.com/padurean/scalatic) repo and run with\r\n\r\n  `sbt \"run /path/to/your/blog\"`\r\n\r\n  OR\r\n\r\n  Download the latest Scalactic release as a\r\n  [single jar](https://github.com/padurean/scalatic/releases/download/0.1.0/scalatic-0.1.0.jar)\r\n  and run with\r\n\r\n  `java -jar scalatic-0.1.0 /path/to/your/blog`\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE**s:\r\n\r\n  - To build Scalatic as one JAR, run `sbt one-jar`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
